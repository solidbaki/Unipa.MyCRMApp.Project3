# Unipa.MyCRMApp.Project3

MyCRM is the third project I delivered during my internship. This document aims to give an understanding of MyCRM to my responsibles in İzmir University of Economics and 
to my place of internship, Unipa.Entire work belongs to me and done for Unipa.

MyCRM is a CRM application which serves for four types of users: Employee, Client, Admin and DepartmentManager:
*Employee’s can work on tasks, update and close them.
*Client’s can request and monitor tasks.
*Department Manager’s can assign tasks to the Employee’s.
*Admins can Add/Delete/Update Employee’s, Departments and DepartmentManager’s.
